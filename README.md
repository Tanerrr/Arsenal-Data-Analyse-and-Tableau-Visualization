Arsenal Data Analyse and Tableau Visualization
---

**Tableau** software is one of the fastest growing data visualization tools which is currently being used in the BI industry. 
It is a good way to change or transform the raw set of data into an easily understandable format with little technical skills and coding knowledge.

In this small project, I analyzed the 2018 2019 season data of the Arsenal football team. I visualized some statistical results that I consider important with Tableau.

Anyone can see this visualization in "Tableau Public" from the link below.
